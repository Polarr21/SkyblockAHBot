# SkyblockAHBot
A skyblock AH bot. Have a booster cookie on so you can use /AH to open the auction house. Then, run the command /Binscan, and the bot will start automatically finding and buying BIN listings for way below what they are worth. You can type /filter to customize what types of BIN listings the bot is able to buy. It is completely non-detectable as it simulates how a normal player would navigate through the AH menu. The mod also beats out many other flipper mods as it does not utilize the API to find its snipes, instead the bot manually searches, so you do not need to wait for the API to refresh.
